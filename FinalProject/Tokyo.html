      <p> HISTORY: Tokyo was initially a simple fishing village called Edo before the Edo clan fortified it in the twelfth century. The famous Edo Castle was built 200 years  later and it became the residence of the central government in 1509 when Tokugawa Ieyasu became shogun and moved there. Edo came to grow into a huge city with a population of over a million by the mid-eighteenth century due to the city being the center of culture and politics. Throughout this time, the Emperor resided in Kyoto, which was the formal capital of the nation. This remained until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when the Tokugawa Shogunate ended and imperial rule was restored. The Emperor moved to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. Thus, Tokyo became the capital of Japan. </p>
      <p> FUN FACT: Tokyo is known for its neon signs scattered all throughout the city, giving it a very unique vibe during nighttime that one can only witness to its full extent in person! </p>
      <p> FOODS: Tokyo  has many delicacies that are so popular that they have become the standard version of the dish. A small number of these delicacies include takoyaki (fried octopus balls), ramen, and soba ( buckwheat noodles). </p>

              Sensoji Temple is one of the most popular and appealing temples in Tokyo. It was built in the year 645, making it the oldest temple in Tokyo. The temple was made to worship Kannon, the goddess of mercy. The temple has a 200 meter long shopping street (named Nakamise) that sells typical Japanese souvenirs and treats from the Asakusa district.

              The current Imperial Palace is located on the former site of Edo Castle, a large park area surrounded by moats and massive stone walls in the center of Tokyo, a short walk from Tokyo Station. It is the residence of Japan's Imperial Family. The inner grounds of the palace are not open to the public, but visitors can still go on a tour of the palace’s exterior. The Imperial Palace East Gardens, however, are open to the public throughout the year.

              The Tokyo National Museum is the oldest and largest of Japan's top-level national museums. It consists of six separate buildings that are all large enough to be called museums on their own. It features one of the largest and best collections of art and archeological Japanese artifacts, made up of over 110,000 individual items that include nearly a hundred national treasures. In addition, visitors can see temporary exhibitions that are held regularly.

              Ueno Park is a large public park next to Ueno Station in central Tokyo. The park grounds were originally part of Kaneiji Temple, which used to be one of the city's largest and wealthiest temples. In the spring (specifically late March and early April), Ueno Park becomes even more lively and colorful when cherry blossoms begin to fall. It is also home to Ueno Zoo— Japan’s oldest zoo— and is most famous for its giant panda bears that commemorated the normalization of relations between Japan and China.
