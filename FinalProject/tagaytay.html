      <p> HISTORY: Following the end of the Philippine Revolution, Tagaytay became a place of refuge and hideaway for revolutionaries of several nearby provinces. Because of its wide expanse of forests, it was a perfect sanctuary and pursuit place for the Katipuneros. As a result, the Katipuneros used to call the place “Mananagaytay”, which means traversing the ridges of Tagaytay. </p>
      <p> FUN FACT: Tagaytay stands at the highest point in the province of Cavite at 709 meters above-ground. </p>
      <p> FOODS: Some authentic Filipino foods one must try during their visit include pancit, a Filipino version of lo mein with thinner rice noodles, and lechon, oven-roasted pork with crispy skin. For dessert, halo-halo is gaining popularity as a worldwide famous dessert that typically consists of shaved ice, evaporated, milk, ice cream, and a variety of other toppings. </p>

              Originally named “palace in the sky”, the People’s Park in the Sky is a historical urban park that sits atop Mount Sungay. It was initially built with the purpose to host the visit of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, but construction ceased when Reagan canceled his visit. Within this park, you can find the Marian Chapel that was built in the latter half of 1974, with the installation of the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the child Jesus by Hernan D. Reyes.

              Museo Orlina is a showcase of the artistry of internationally acclaimed Ramon Orlina, pioneer and foremost practitioner of glass sculpture in the country. Before Orlina, glass was mainly appreciated exclusively for its utilitarian function as drinking vessels, window glass panes, or automotive windshields. Orlina, however, saw beyond the humble origin of this industrial glass residue. The result is an exultant body of works that, throughout the decades, have dazzled the art scene and are prized by numerous collectors. Ultimately, Orlina has revolutionized the medium by elevating it to the dignity and respectability of art.
