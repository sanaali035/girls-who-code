      <p> HISTORY:   The earliest people in Latvia were stone age hunters and gatherers who arrived there after the last ice age about 9000 BC. However the ancestors of today's Latvians were Baltic tribes who migrated to the area about 2,000 BC. During the 12th century AD, some of the last pagans settled in a Latvian fishing village known as Riga, so they built a fortified settlement there. From 1944 to 1991, Latvia was swept by communism. During January 1991, the Soviet Union sent troops to attack the TV tower in Riga. Many Latvians gathered in Riga to protest and to stop further Soviet attacks. In August 1991, communism collapse in Latvia and the USA recognized Latvian independence in September 1991.  </p><p>  FUN FACTS:   Latvia is multicultural, with a large Russian population due to its Soviet history. This can be a somewhat touchy subject, as depopulation of ethnic Latvians and Russification were the policies of the time.</p>

      <p> FOODS:   Bread soup is made from rye bread mixed with sugar, dry fruits, and whipped cream. It is considered to be a dessert, most popular during the holidays. Pickles and Sauerkraut are a popular combination in Latvia. Stallholders let you help yourself to mounds of crunchy sauerkraut and you'll find all sorts of pickles including carrots, tomatoes, garlic, mushrooms, green beans, cauliflower and of course cucumbers flavored with a variety of herbs and spices. Sauerkraut is a Latvian staple and features in side dishes, dumplings, and soups.   </p>
