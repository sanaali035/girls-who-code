  <h3>Deforestation</h3>
<p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	  <li>Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forest land for use such as arable land, pasture, urban use, logged area, or wasteland. Deforestation can also be seen as removal of forests leading to several imbalances ecologically and environmentally and results in declines in habitat and biodiversity. Urbanization, Mining, Fires, Logging and Agricultural activities are few of the causes of deforestation.</li>
	  <li>It is estimated that within 100 years there will be no rainforests.</li>
	  <li>One and a half acres of forest is cut down every second.</li>
		<li>
			 Loss of forests contributes between 12 percent and 17 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions.	</li>
	</ul></p>

<div id="Fun Facts" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
  <p>  <font color=#F1F2D0>
		Forests cover around 4 billion hectares or 30 percent of Earth’s land surface
<p>
	Forests have hundreds of billions of trees

</p>
<p>
	Forests store massive amounts of carbon and afford other important ecosystem services upon which life on Earth depends

</p>
<p>

		One-eighth of global forests are managed for biodiversity conservation.
		According to the U.N., about 13 percent of the world’s forests, or 5.24 million sq km, are managed primarily for biodiversity conservation. The United States (65 million ha), Brazil (47 million ha), and Mexico (28 million ha) lead the world in terms of forest area designated for biological diversity conservation. Brazil, with 206 million ha, has the largest forest area within designated protected areas.

<p>
	The Boreal forest (aka Taiga) is the largest land habitat on the planet
	It runs across northern USA and Canada, southern Iceland, across Norway, Finland, Sweden, through Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and northern Japan. This region is one of the most threatened by climate change and has experienced some of the most dramatic temperature increases anywhere on Earth. Not to mention the threat from clearcutting for toilet paper, timber logging and, in Canada, tar sands oil extraction which now covers an area larger than England.
</p>

<p>
	More species of plant and animal live in the rainforest than any other land habitat
	The Indonesian rainforest alone is home to one fifth of all plant and animal life yet it is disappearing at a faster rate than at any other time. There are now fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild as their habitat is destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations.

</p>
<p>
		.More than 25% of the medicines we use originate in rainforest plants
</p>

<p>
	The tallest tree in the world is called Hyperion

</p>
<p>
	The world’s oldest non-clonal tree is a recently-discovered and as yet unnamed Great Basin bristlecone pine tree from the White Mountains in California
