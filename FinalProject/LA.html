    <p>Los Angeles is located in Southern California, and is the most populous city in the state. It is a must-see for any traveler, as Los Angeles is filled with many landmarks and attractions.

      <p> HISTORY:  The written history of Los Angeles began with a Spanish colony town that was populated by 11 descendants of Spanish families which were known as "Los Pobladores". They established a settlement in Southern California that changed little in the three decades after 1848, when California became part of the United States. Greater change came when  the Santa Fe railroad line from Chicago to Los Angeles was completed in 1885. As it grew rapidly, Hollywood made the city world-famous. Since the 1960s, growth has slowed—and traffic delays have become famous. Los Angeles was a pioneer in freeway development as the public transit system deteriorated. New arrivals, especially from Mexico and Asia, have transformed the demographic base since the 1960s. </p>
<p> FUN FACT: Los Angeles is an abbreviation of the full name that derives from the Spanish language and translates to “The Angels”;  its full name is “El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula”, translating to “town of our lady the Queen of Angels of the River Porciúncula” in english. </p>
<p> FOODS: Los Angeles is mainly known for its tacos and burgers. With food trucks scattered all over the city and the famous In-N-Out Burger restaurant chain, it is no wonder that these foods are best made in LA. </p>

              The Huntington Gardens are a series of garden areas for the general public to enjoy and look at. The founder, Henry E. Huntington, purchased the San Marino Ranch in 1903. By teaming up with his superintendent William Hertrich, the duo was able to fully develop the foundation of the Huntington botanical gardens. Today, the institution’s goal is to support and promote the appreciation of the humanities, the arts, and botanical science.

              The Gamble House is a breaktaking example of architecture from the Arts and Crafts movement in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The house and its furnishings were designed by architects Charles and Henry Greene in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter & Gamble Company. The architecture is preserved with the goal of spreading more knowledge of the arts and culture to the public.
