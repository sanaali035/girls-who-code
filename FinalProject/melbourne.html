              Melbourne’s Botanic Gardens were established in 1846 by Lieutenant Governor Charles La Trobe. Over the next 60 years, this swampy site was transformed into the world-famous landscape we know today. In 1958, Queen Elizabeth II bestowed the ‘Royal’ prefix on the Gardens. Visitors can enjoy perusing through the several unique landscapes the Gardens has to offer while also getting an inside look into the science and research behind the institution.

              The Great Ocean Road stretches for 240 kilometers long the southern coast of Australia from the Victorian cities of Torquay and Allansford. It is the world’s largest war memorial: after the end of the first World War, more than 3000 returned soldiers from Australia participated in the construction of this road. With the first half officially opened  in 1922, the Great Ocean Road holds great historic and cultural significance to the country.

              Melbourne’s iconic laneways date back to the Victorian era. They were initially used as service laneways for horses and carts. However, since the 1990s, these laneways have been gentrified. Their value to Australia’s heritage had not been forgotten, but today, the laneways are mostly known worldwide for their acclaimed urban art and have become major tourist destinations.
