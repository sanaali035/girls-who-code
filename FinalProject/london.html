      <p>  HISTORY: The Romans founded London about 50 AD. Its name is derived from the Celtic word Londinios, which means the place of the bold one. After they invaded Britain in 43 AD the Romans built a bridge across the Thames. They later decided it was an excellent place to build a port.In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today.In 1963 a new division of London was made, comprising the old town and 32 metropolitan boroughs, and these are the divisions which can be seen today.  </p>
      <p>FUN FACT: Trident Studios, off Wardour Street, is where The Beatles made much of the White Album and David Bowie recorded Ziggy Stardust. </p>
      <p>FOODS: London is best known for its large breakfasts that typically consist of eggs, bacon, sausage, grilled tomato, and baked beans served with toast. Scones with clotted cream and jam are also a classic British food. The most common types of scones are plain scones and scones with raisins.
