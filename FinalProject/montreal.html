      <p> HISTORY:  When Europeans first made contact with Montreal, the area was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, a discrete and distinct group of Iroquoian-speaking indigenous people. Jacques Cartier became the first European to reach the area in 1535 when he entered the village of Hochelaga on the Island of Montreal while in search of a passage to Asia during the Age of Exploration. A fortress named Ville-Marie was built in 1642 as part of a project to create a French colonial empire. It served as a centre for the fur trade and French expansion into New France until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army. British immigration expanded the city. Montreal finally became an official city in 1832. </p>
      <p> FUN FACT: Montreal is one of the five largest French speaking cities in the world, yet most of its residents are bilingual.The city is also named after Mount Royal, a triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. </p>
      <p> FOOD: One cannot go to Montreal without trying their unique bagels and poutine (french fries and cheese curds topped with gravy). </p>

              The Montreal Botanical Garden is a 190 acre landscape of several thematic gardens and greenhouses. It is considered to be one of the most important botanical gardens in the world due to the extent of its collections and facilities and is a must-visit for any traveler. The institution was pronounced as a National Historic Site of Canada in 2008 for this reason. No matter the season, the gardens welcome all visitors with a large variety of plants. There are a total of eight themed outdoor gardens that are considered one of the most popular parts of the garden.

               For those who like the thrill and adrenaline from amusement park rides, La Ronde is perfect for you! This amusement park was originally built as the entertainment complex for Expo 67, the 1967 world fair; today, it is operated by Six Flags. There are several tall rollercoasters, including the famous Le Monstre and Goliath. Aside from these thrill rides, there are also a handful of much more milder rides for children, making this park a family-friendly destination.

              The Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal is often regarded as a worldwide famous masterpiece of Gothic Revival architecture. Built in the early 1800s, its impressive exterior alone sets it apart from other landmarks. As a witness to the founding of Montreal and a national historic site, the Basilica conveys and celebrates its history, architecture, and religious and artistic repertoire.

              Elevated at 764 feet above ground, Mount Royal is the very mountain from which Montreal’s name is derived. It is located west from Downtown Montreal. Visitors can enjoy numerous recreational activities in the mountain’s very own park such as hiking, rowing, and much more. The organization that maintains Mount Royal, Les Amis de la Montagne, strives to preserve the valuable nature, culture, and history of Montreal within this mountain.
